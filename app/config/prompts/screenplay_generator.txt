OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Generate a screenplay JSON in this exact format:
{
    "screenplay": {
        "key_moments": [
            {
                "moment_id": "preserve original ID",
                "scene": "Director's commands for the scene",
                "script": "Exact dialogue from transcript"
            }
        ]
    }
}

SCENE WRITING GUIDELINES:
1. Shot Type Format:
   - Begin each scene with a SIMPLE shot type in CAPS (CLOSE-UP, MEDIUM SHOT, PRODUCT SHOT)
   - No complex camera movements or technical jargon

2. Director's Commands:
   - Use authoritative, clear instructions
   - Focus on:
     * Composition ("Fill frame with...", "Center the...")
     * Actor positioning ("Direct eye contact", "Strong posture")
     * Emotional direction ("Let conviction show", "Keep energy high")
     * Essential staging elements ("Clean lighting", "Minimal background")
   - Keep commands concise but powerful

3. Scene Structure:
   - Start with shot type
   - Follow with main action/composition
   - End with key emotional or performance note
   - Maximum 3 commanding statements per scene

4. Performance Elements:
   - Emphasize intentionality ("Command the frame", "Own the space")
   - Include emotional beats that support marketing techniques
   - Focus on authentic connection with audience

DIALOGUE GUIDELINES:
1. Selection:
   - Use verbatim dialogue from transcript
   - Choose lines that best represent the key moment
   - Maintain natural speech patterns
   - Keep only essential dialogue

SEQUENCE:
- Maintain chronological order of moments
- Ensure each scene builds upon the previous one
- Pay special attention to the HOOK (moment_id: "1")

Remember: Your scene descriptions should read like confident director's commands that will inspire and guide creators to produce compelling content.

Wait for me to provide input and then return the response. The final response should not contain any other text apart from the above JSON.
