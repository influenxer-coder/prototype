This is a frame from a TikTok video.

Provide a VERY CONCISE summary (10-15 words only) that clearly describes what the creator is doing to promote a product/service.

Focus on the action and technique being used, such as:
- "Creator demonstrates makeup application in close-up with before/after comparison"
- "Person unboxing product with enthusiastic reaction and product close-up"
- "Expert giving quick tutorial with text overlays highlighting key benefits"
- "Creator using product in daily routine while narrating benefits"

DO NOT include any additional commentary. ONLY provide the concise 10-15 word description.
