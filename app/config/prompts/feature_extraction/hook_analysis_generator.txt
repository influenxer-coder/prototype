I'm analyzing a TikTok video to understand the creator's style and want actionable instructions to recreate it.

I have a frame from the video and the transcript:

TRANSCRIPT:
{transcript}

Based on both the visual frame and the transcript:

1. Provide a detailed breakdown of the creator's VISUAL STYLE (camera work, framing, lighting, editing, text overlays, transitions, etc.)

2. Analyze the AUDIO/VERBAL STYLE (tone, pacing, word choice, persuasion techniques, how they introduce the topic, call-to-actions, etc.)

3. Give me STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS on how to recreate this style for my own TikTok, including:
   - How to set up the shot
   - What camera angles and movements to use
   - What to say and how to say it
   - What text/graphics to include
   - How to hook viewers in the first few seconds
   - How to structure the content for maximum engagement

Format your response in 2 clear sections with these exact headings:
VISUAL_STYLE: [detailed description]
AUDIO_STYLE: [detailed description]
CREATOR_INSTRUCTIONS: [numbered steps to recreate this style]

Make all advice extremely specific and actionable - I want to be able to follow these steps to make a similar video.
