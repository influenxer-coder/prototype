  "transcript": "Don't know what collagen powder to take? I can fix that. Someone who's never done a sponsored post or affiliate marketing. This one is unflavored. You can put this in your soup. \n You can put matter of fact, I have some right here. One serving has 23 grams of protein. 23 grams of protein in my coffee. If you're thinking collagen isn't gonna work, then don't take it. Don't do it. \n On a lazy collagen, eggshell membrane collagen, and there's an enzyme blend. This one, fast and easy. Sometimes you just want fast and easy. Great for your nails because these are my natural nails. It's great for your skin. \n That's not my skin. That's my hair and skin. Okay? I love you. Happy collagen taking.",
